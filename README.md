A collection of reusable Svelte components developed by Noetic Labs. This library provides a set of UI components built with Svelte 5 for use in your Svelte or SvelteKit applications.

**Note:** We are currently using SvelteKit specific features and conventions, so this library will not work with Svelte applications that do not use SvelteKit until further notice.

## Inspiration

This design system is heavily inspired by the excellent work done by the team behind IBM's [Carbon Design System](https://carbondesignsystem.com/). While not a direct port or clone, we aim to capture its principles of consistency, modularity, and professionalism within a Svelte context, tailored for our needs at Noetic Laboratories.

## Features

*   **Modern:** Built with Svelte 5.
*   **Type-Safe:** Includes TypeScript definitions for better developer experience.
*   **Modular:** Import only the components you need.
*   **Core Styling:** Includes a base stylesheet (`core.css`).

## Installation

Currently, this library is intended for direct installation from its GitHub repository.

```
# Using npm
npm install github:NoeticLaboratories/nlds-svelte

# Using yarn
yarn add github:NoeticLaboratories/nlds-svelte

# Using pnpm
pnpm add github:NoeticLaboratories/nlds-svelte
```

You can also install from a specific branch, tag, or commit hash:

```
npm install github:NoeticLaboratories/nlds-svelte#branch-name/OR/commit-hash
```

**Important Note:** Installation directly from Git relies on npm/yarn/pnpm executing the `prepare` script (`npm run build`) after cloning to generate the necessary `dist` files. Alternatively, ensure the `dist` directory is pre-built and committed to the specific branch or tag you are installing from for maximum reliability.

## Usage

### 1. Import Core Styles

You need to import the core stylesheet in your application. This is typically done in your main layout file (e.g., `src/routes/+layout.svelte` in SvelteKit) or your main application entry point.

```
import '@noeticlabs/nlds-svelte/styles/core.css';
// Import other global styles or components if needed
```

Or in a JavaScript/TypeScript entry file:

```
// src/app.js (example)
import '@noeticlabs/nlds-svelte/styles/core.css';
```

### 2. Import and Use Components

Import components directly from their path within the library as defined in `package.json` exports.

```
<script>
  import { Button } from '@noeticlabs/nlds-svelte';

  let count = 0;
  const handleButtonClick = () => count++;
</script>

<h1>Welcome to NLDS Svelte</h1>

<Button kind="primary" on:click={handleButtonClick}>
  Click Me ({count})
</Button>
```

## Development

To contribute or run this project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/NoeticLaboratories/nlds-svelte.git
    cd nlds-svelte
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```
    npm install
    # or yarn install / pnpm install
    ```
3.  **Run the development server (for the demo/docs app):**
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```
4.  **Build the library:**
    ```
    npm run build
    ```
5.  **Linting and Type Checking:**
    ```
    npm run lint
    npm run check
    ```

## Repository Structure

*   `src/lib`: Contains the library source code (components, styles, utilities).
    *   `src/lib/components`: Individual Svelte components.
    *   `src/lib/styles`: Core stylesheets (e.g., `core.css`).
*   `src/routes`: Contains the development/documentation site (if using SvelteKit).
*   `dist`: Contains the built output of the library (generated by `npm run build`). This is what gets used when the package is installed.
